# PokéSketch

This project is a multiplayer, real-time Pokémon-themed draw and guess game built using React for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and Socket.IO for real-time communication between players.

## Game Overview

Players join a lobby where they can set several game settings including: draw time per round, Pokémon generation to draw from, and the number of rounds. Once the game starts, each player draws a random Pokémon from the selected generations from memory and then players can vote on the best drawings. The game continues for the set number of rounds and then declares a winner based on points accumulated.
